# React Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe project made with React.

I'm 100% open for suggestions, as it's my first ever work with React and I know
basically nothing about best practices with this framework.

## What is Tic-Tac-Toe?

Tic-Tac-Toe is a very basic turn-based game which involves two players, playing
against each other.

Each player is assigned a symbol (either X or O).

An empty 3x3 grid is given to the players. The turn player (chosen at random at
first) can write their symbol in any empty space on the grid, then passes the
turn to the other player.

If one of the players manages to put 3 of their symbols on the grid in a
straight line (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally), they win the
game. If the grid is full and neither player manages to win, the game is a draw.

## Features

You can play Tic-Tac-Toe against anyone in local multiplayer mode. That's it,
that's all you can do for now.
